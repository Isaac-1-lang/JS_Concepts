 // As we know also the indentions between elements are nodes in our DOM tree in order to prevent their effects we can use childNodes[0] or using children 
 // like firstElementChild and lastElementChild like while applying styles they will be so helpful 
 // remember that childNodes[0] and firstChild are identical
 // but firstElementChild is a solution
 // use previousElementSibling and nextElementSibling
